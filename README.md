# odin-tictactoe
A Tic Tac Toe game page, as assigned in The Odin Project!

The game is simply played by clicking the blue squares. The player with token X always starts. Player names can be changed with the form on the left, and the "Restart" button can be pressed to reset everything (game state and player names).
